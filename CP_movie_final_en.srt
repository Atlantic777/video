1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,100
To seize this moment we have to use technology

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,350
to open up our democracy

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,240
Let me ask you a very simple question

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,750
Does it concern you

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,450
that the governement is spying on you?

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,890
They are not doing anything wrong

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,920
and they have nothing to hide

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,970
and they are not terrorists

9
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,970
What's your Facebook password?

10
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,350
I'm not gonna give you my Facebook password

11
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,500
What's your bank account number?

12
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,120
Oh, got you. NSA.

13
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,030
What did you search last night on Google?

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,610
Err

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,260
Porn

16
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,730
I don't like this interview

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,060
If you have nothing to hide

18
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,720
why not let someone film your bedroom and bathroom?

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,500
 All could be published on the internet...

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,820
If you have nothing to hide

21
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,920
let someone use your logins and password to your Facebook and Google accounts

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,500
publish them to let everyone rummage through all your stuff

23
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,600
And it is also the case that I want to have a world

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,860
where everyone has privacy

25
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,220
and thus dignity, confidentiality and integrity

26
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,220
in their daily lives

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,340
without having to ask for it

28
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,910
to beg it from a master

29
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,560
Because it is the case that

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,680
when you ask someone for those things

31
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,100
they may not grant them

32
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,700
and then you will know you are not free

33
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,920
<i>Ha, ho, hey, hey</i>

34
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,630
<i>Here comes the man from the NSA</i>

35
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,580
Does the NSA routinely intercept

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,800
American citizens emails?

37
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,840
No.

38
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,610
Does the NSA intercept

39
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,970
Americans cellphone conversations?

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,640
No.

41
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,530
Google searches?

42
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,410
No.

43
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,150
Text messages?

44
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:33,840
No.

45
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,320
Amazon.com orders?

46
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,230
No.

47
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,480
Bank records?

48
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,180
No.

49
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,320
<i>I give you the surveillance state, ladies and generals</i>

50
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,620
Director Clapper, does the NSA collect data

51
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,090
on hundreds of millions of Americans?

52
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,100
No, sir.

53
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,220
It does not?

54
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,410
Not wittingly.

55
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,960
<i>Ho, ha, hey, hey</i>

56
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,190
<i>Son of a bitch from the NSA</i>

57
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,040
<i>Ha, ho, hey, hey</i>

58
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,370
<i>Fuck the guy from the NSA</i>

59
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,090
<i>Good morning NSA, I'm an insider</i>

60
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,460
<i>But you're watching me</i>

61
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,230
<i>which means I can't be one</i>

62
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,800
<i>Reading my diary you know a lot about me</i>

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,320
<i>It's interesting especially when it's a secret</i>

64
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,700
<i>They know if you are broke</i>

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,130
<i>they know if you make cash</i>

66
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,080
<i>You can't get out without papers</i>

67
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,820
<i>Passport!</i>

68
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,440
<i>Meet the guy from Wikileaks and confess</i>

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,080
<i>And get convicted by the country I fought for</i>

70
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,760
NSA, and the intelligence community in general,

71
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,530
is focussed on getting intelligence wherever it can

72
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,570
by any means possible

73
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,410
It believes on the grounds of a sort of self-certification

74
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,880
that they serve the national interest

75
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,520
<i>You know</i>

76
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,400
<i>we watch everyone from up here</i>

77
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,720
<i>We don't miss anything </i>

78
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,090
<i>Have you been naughty once</i>

79
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,600
<i>Dude, we're listening to everything</i>

80
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,800
<i>looking for caviar and truffles</i>

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,420
<i>There are many methods to decrypt data</i>

82
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,220
The NSA specifically targets the communications of everyone

83
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,220
It ingests them by default

84
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,960
It collects them in its system and it filters them

85
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,570
and it analyses them and it measures them

86
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,260
and it stores them for periods of time

87
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,230
simply because that's the easiest and most efficient

88
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,780
and most valuable way to achieve these ends

89
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,970
<i>We're all wiretapped now</i>

90
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,480
<i>We're all being fed lies</i>

91
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,280
<i>Not long til we get all the rats out</i>

92
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,010
NSA victims didn't have a face for a long time

93
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,970
but this secret NSA document can change it

94
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,980
it contains the IP address

95
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,840
of the student Sebastian Hahn

96
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,510
My server is...

97
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,720
on this list of internet addresses

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,960
This is...

99
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,530
a bit shocking

100
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,370
You don't have to have done anything wrong

101
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,570
You simply have to eventually fall under suspicion from somebody

102
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,380
even by a wrong call

103
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,610
and then they can use the system to go back in time

104
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,920
and scrutinize every decision you have ever made

105
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,810
every friend you have ever discussed something with

106
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,940
and attack you on that basis

107
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,750
to sort of derive suspicion from an innocent life

108
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,700
and paint anyone in the context of a wrongdoer

109
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,930
What these revelations

110
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,240
the ones that we published thus far

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,300
and the ones that we'll continue to be publishing in the future

112
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,620
what they really illustrate is exactly what you said

113
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,540
It's just that

114
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,850
they don't call it Total Information Awareness anymore

115
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,810
that was a little bit too honest of a term

116
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,490
That was probably the main reason

117
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,850
why it created a such uproar

118
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,940
because it was just too nakedly clear

119
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,220
what it was intending to accomplish

120
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,980
But what the NSA is doing, not just domestically, but globally

121
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,340
is creating a total information awareness system

122
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,290
William worked for the US governement for 32 years

123
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,240
He was responsible for electronic espionage

124
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,760
A decade ago, when the authorities began to bug US citizens

125
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,440
he left the service

126
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,270
The fight against terrorism

127
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,830
seemed to change the rules of engagement over night

128
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,000
There virtually is nothing in the network that they can't have a copy of

129
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,210
If they start targeting you, so what?

130
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,840
They already have your data

131
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,100
I can't find out what they are doing with my data

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,490
But I know they have it

133
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,020
So I make sure I write in there whatever I have to say about them, I say that in there

134
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,700
So that when they collect it, they know what I'm thinking of them

135
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,650
The question is not: do you have something to hide?

136
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,810
The question is whether we control the governement

137
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,040
or the governement controls us

138
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,900
So what can people do?

139
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,900
First they can declare themselves to be free

140
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,300
And secondly they can declare it

141
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,840
by using strong encryption when they use telephones

142
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,890
by talking to journalists about the things that they experience

143
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,240
by actually taking steps to defund organisations that fundamentally violate the constitution

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,130
that reinterpret the G10 privacy laws

145
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,120
that are criminal in nature

146
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,610
<i>Sorry to interrupt but we're picking up</i>

147
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,290
<i>a signal from beyond the space-time continuum</i>

148
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,660
<i>Quick, switch on the Juice Channeling Portal</i>

149
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,020
<i>Wait... is that... George Orwell?!</i>

150
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:19,920
<i>Good day to you</i>

151
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,690
<i>Wow... what do we owe this honour to?</i>

152
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,960
<i>I tried to warn you noobs</i>

153
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,440
<i>but I see you are actually fools</i>

154
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,860
<i>or else you thought this was an instruction manual</i>

155
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,540
<i>Yes... so can you advise us?</i>

156
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,480
<i>What would you have us do?</i>

157
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,960
<i>An open and universal internet</i>

158
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,420
<i>is the most effective tool you have</i>

159
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
<i>to address the issues that afflict the world at hand</i>

160
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,800
<i>therefore, protecting it is the most essential task </i>

161
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,580
<i>that stands before your generation</i>

162
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,760
<i>I think I understand...</i>

163
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,980
<i>Hush, man. You must not lose the internet</i>

164
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,850
<i>Heed this mantra:</i>

165
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,960
<i>"who controls the internet controls the data</i>

166
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,450
<i>and who controls the data, controls the future"</i>

167
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,180
<i>We're loosing you</i>

168
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,880
<i>I leave you with a tool to use...</i>

169
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,410
<i>An onion?</i>

170
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,410
<i>Don't be simple, Robert, this is but a simile</i>

171
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,650
<i>It stands for "Tor" - Tor?</i>

172
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,220
<i>Google it! It's for anonymity</i>

173
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,980
<i>This onion router open network helps considerably against tyranny</i>

174
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,920
<i>But its abilities only work if all you f**kers use it consistently</i>

175
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,540
<i>and even if you don't use it, run it so its force swells</i>

176
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,570
<i>Thanks, Mr. Orwell</i>

177
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,740
<i>From now on call me: George Torwell</i>

178
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,770
<i>if we'd had such tools when I wrote this, well</i>

179
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,250
<i>it would've been so much simple to tell Big Brother to go fu**k himself</i>

180
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,250
For example, who here is a biologist?

181
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,250
Raise you hand if you are a biologist

182
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,550
Anyone? Not one person, great  - There's one

183
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,800
One person, great.

184
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,370
Now raise your hand if you feel you have mastered the ability

185
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,920
to reduce your risk about having safe sex

186
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,850
in terms of reducing the threat that sex can pose

187
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,810
Who here has ever functionally and properly used a condom?

188
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,400
It's ok, don't be embarassed!

189
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,030
You should be! You should be embarassed...

190
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,130
the people that didn't raise your hands in particular

191
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,830
That's a weird thing

192
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,460
I don't really know what to say to you

193
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,500
But the people that raised you hand, you'll...

194
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,670
We've just got a very innocent audience here, that's all

195
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,530
Did you raise your hand both times, biologist?

196
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,470
Ok, good, good!

197
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,880
So what we know is that we can learn something here

198
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,820
which is that the biologist both understands how to protect himself

199
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,230
and he also understands what it is, in a technical sense, in a scientific sense

200
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,250
what it is he is protecting himself from, and so on

201
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,250
And everybody else that raised their hand

202
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,060
doesn't self-identify as an expert

203
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,210
and yet you probably have great sex, in a protected manner that reduces your risk

204
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,170
We should be able to accomplish this with cryptography, with encryption

205
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,200
We should be able to understand that we have an epidemic of surveillance

206
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,620
and that we need to practice harm-reduction strategies with cultural norms that promote it

207
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,670
If you wanna connect to me, you have to do it safely!

208
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,850
<i>You're the light that the world's demanding</i>

209
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:38,580
<i>Make it bright and make things clear, oh, woah</i>

210
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,290
<i>We're not gonna sit in darkness</i>

211
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,220
<i>We're not gonna live with fear, oh, woah</i>

212
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,840
Nothing to hide?

213
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,440
<i>Agencies against We the People</i>

214
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,470
<i>Don't stoop, don't grovel to no government steeple</i>

215
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,460
<i>We can force anybody to make a new choice</i>

216
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,050
<i>when we build a movement, each raising our voice</i>

217
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,050
<i>Build a movement by raising your voice</i>

218
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,850
<i>Build a movement by raising your voice</i>

219
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,590
Encrypt.

220
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,940
Now.
